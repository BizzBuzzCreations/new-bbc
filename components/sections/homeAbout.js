          CSS background layers — that's what broke the fade earlier: a
          gradient's `background-size: contain` just fills the whole
          positioning area since gradients have no intrinsic size, so it
          never actually matched the photo's own contain-computed box).
          The image box is now full-bleed to the right edge of the
          viewport (`flex-1`, no right padding/max-width, no rounded
          corners on that edge) instead of sitting in a padded, capped
          column with black space to its right — only the text column on
          the left keeps its own padding. */}

              few big jumps — the old 4-stop version read as a flat block
              of black with a visible "edge" where it cut off into the
              photo. This eases through gradually (roughly matching an
              ease-out curve) and finishes later, at 52%, so the
              black-to-photo transition looks like a natural falloff
              rather than a hard wall. No right-side fade needed — this
              shot doesn't have a neighbouring building crowding that
