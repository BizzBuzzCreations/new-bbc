// one quick wheel-flick, reading as "appears and vanishes instantly"
// instead of an actual slow-motion effect; now there's real distance for
// it to play out over); the inner panel is `sticky top-0 h-screen`, so it
// stays pinned filling the viewport while the user scrolls past it, and
// the text scales up purely as a function of how far they've scrolled.

  // whole back half of the scroll was spent continuously recomputing and
  // repainting a massive (up to ~22x), GPU-heavy blurred layer that was
  // fully invisible (opacity 0) the entire time. That's exactly what was
  // reading as the stats content "gradually disappearing": the browser
  // straining to composite that invisible layer every frame was dragging
  // the whole frame's brightness/render down along with it. Once scale
  // and blur stop changing (clamped after 0.4, same as opacity), there's

  // around 35-45%) which made it possible for the two to independently
  // drift out of sync — panels reading as "gone"/non-interactive at
  // exactly the moment the stats content was on screen. Sharing one
  // value means they always appear and stay together: fades in right as
  // the headline fades out (0.3-0.4), then holds at full opacity with no
  // further keyframe all the way to the end — nothing left to make it
