        answer:
          "A website is often the first interaction a potential customer has with your business, and most people decide whether to trust you within seconds of landing on it.

        question: "How much do SEO services cost in India?",
        answer:
          "Cost depends on scope, competition level, and whether technical, content, and link building work are all included. We scope pricing after understanding your specific website and goals, rather than offering a flat rate that doesn't reflect what your project actually needs.",

        question: "How long does SEO take to show results?",

        answer:

        question:
          "Which platform is right for my business — Google, Meta, or both?",

      {
        question: "How much does business consulting cost in India?",
        answer:
          "Cost depends on scope — a focused strategic review costs less than ongoing advisory covering multiple areas of your business. We scope pricing after understanding your specific situation, rather than offering a flat rate upfront.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "What's the difference between a consultant and a business coach?",
        answer:
          "A consultant typically analyzes your specific business and market to develop a strategic plan, while a coach often focuses more broadly on leadership development. We combine strategic analysis with practical, ongoing support.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does a typical consulting engagement take?",
        answer:
          "Timeline depends on scope — a focused review can take a few weeks, while ongoing advisory typically continues over several months as your business situation develops.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do you work with small businesses, or only larger companies?",
        answer:
          "We work with businesses of various sizes, scoping our approach to fit smaller businesses just as thoughtfully as larger engagements, rather than a one-size-fits-all package.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do you help with execution, or just the strategy itself?",
        answer:
          "We help with both, since a strategy that never gets executed provides little value. We build execution support directly into our engagements.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Is this consulting only for established businesses, or startups too?",
