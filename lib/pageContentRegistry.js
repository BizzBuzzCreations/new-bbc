// Single source of truth for which page sections/fields are editable from
// the admin dashboard's "Website Content" tab. Each field's `default` is
// the real copy the site already ships with — pages fall back to this
// when no override has been saved yet, so nothing breaks/blanks out
// before an admin edits anything.
//
// Field types: "text" (single line), "textarea" (multi-line), "image"
// (upload, stores a URL), "video" (upload, stores a URL), "list"
// (repeatable items — each item is an object whose own shape is given by
// `itemFields`, same type options).
//
// Deliberately NOT editable here: icons, hrefs/links, and anything that
// drives layout (which visual variant a card renders, column counts,
// etc.) — those are design/structure, not content, and stay in code.
//
// Adding a new editable page: add an entry here, then in that page's
// component read `content?.someKey || DEFAULT` instead of the hardcoded
// string. No schema changes needed — PageContent.fields is schemaless.
//
// The 15 /industries/<slug> pages are NOT hand-authored here — they all
// share one identical structure, so their registry entries are generated
// from lib/industryPageContent.js in lib/industryContentRegistry.js and
// merged in below via getPageMeta/getPageDefaults.

                  { question: "What is local SEO and do I need it?", answer: "Local SEO helps businesses rank in location-based searches like \"near me\" queries. It's essential for businesses serving a specific city or region alongside national or global reach." },
                  { question: "Does SEO still work with AI search and Google AI Overviews?", answer: "Yes. SEO remains essential — AI Overviews pull from well-structured, authoritative web content, so strong technical SEO and content quality directly influence AI search visibility." },
                  { question: "What's the difference between SEO and Google Ads?", answer: "SEO builds long-term organic visibility without ongoing ad spend, while Google Ads delivers immediate visibility through paid placements. Most businesses benefit from combining both." },

                  { question: "How fast do Google Ads generate leads?", answer: "Google Ads can generate leads within days of launching, unlike SEO, which takes months — making it effective for immediate visibility and lead flow." },
                  { question: "What's the difference between Google Ads and Meta Ads?", answer: "Google Ads target active search intent (people actively searching), while Meta Ads target audiences based on interests and behavior — both serve different stages of the buyer journey." },
                  { question: "Why isn't my Google Ads campaign converting?", answer: "Common causes include poor audience targeting, weak landing pages, incorrect keyword match types, or insufficient conversion tracking setup." },

                  { question: "Do I need a custom website or is a template enough?", answer: "Templates work for simple sites, but custom development offers better performance, scalability, and brand differentiation for growing businesses." },
                  { question: "Is my website's mobile-friendliness important for SEO?", answer: "Yes. Google uses mobile-first indexing, meaning your site's mobile version directly affects search rankings, not just the desktop version." },
