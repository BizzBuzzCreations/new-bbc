              More Than Outsourcing A Team That Thinks Like You Do
            </h2>
            <p className="text-white/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Outsourcing often feels like handing your business to a stranger. You lose visibility into what's said to customers,
              how data is handled, and whether anyone actually cares about the outcome the way you do. Bizzbuzz Creations was built in Prayagraj to fix exactly that gap.
              We started as a small BPO services provider with one rule: every account should run like an extension of the client's own team,
              not a distant vendor relationship.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
              Today, we work with startups taking their first step into outsourcing services, small businesses in Allahabad needing reliable support,
              and growing companies across India that need a full-scale BPO company for inbound and outbound calling, data entry, and 24/7 customer support outsourcing.
              Whatever the size of your business, the approach stays the same:  we learn your process first, then build a team around it,
              instead of forcing your business into a generic template.
